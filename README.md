I attended EVO (biggest fighting game tournament in the world). Afterwards, I mined twitter using #EVO2016. Then I did some word analyses and made a word cloud (even though I think word clouds are dumb). I had some problems though. First, I found out I was unable to mine tweets mroe than 10 days old. Some of the early tweets were unable to be retrieved. Second, my computer was struggling to get some 200,000+ tweets.
